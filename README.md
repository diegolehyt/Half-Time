## 📋Description
We are creating a fantasy soccer game. In this application, the user will be able to register an account and then login for future visits. Once logged in, the user will have the option to create a fantasy soccer team from professional soccer players around the world. 

The user will be able to select players to fill all 11 spots on their fantasy team. Once all players have been selected, the user will be able to save their fantasy team. 

In addition to this, the user will also be able to update their team with different players whenever they like. Once the user is happy with their team, the user can ‘play a match’ with other teams created from other users. The user can also view current news about the soccer world through a tab on the navbar.

This app allows you to create the team of your dreams without any restrictions. Any user who wishes to have their favorite players from every major league on one team can now do so using our app. This app provides endless entertainment.

In addition, this app can help the user familiarize themselves with professional soccer players around the world, whether it be Lionel Messi, or the american star, Christian Pulisic. This app allows the user to see the latest results in the soccer world as well, always keeping the user informed. 
 
Lastly, this app is free to play, so anyone can join in on the fun.
